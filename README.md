# MARIE 16-bit CPU Architecture Implementation in Logism

The circuit file includes the implementation for the [16-bit MARIE CPU Architecture](https://marie.js.org/book.pdf). The circuit file is made on [Logism](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/), which is a free and open source software for building circuits.

The implementation is done from the very ground up using basic logic gates, registers, and RAM. The circuit file contains two circuits, one contains the implementation of the circuit 
while the main contains the CPU where you can adjust registers and run instructions accordingly.

The complete instruction set is not yet supported and hence some instructions are likely to not work correctly. However, the basic instructions work showcasing the flow. All registers are labelled.
